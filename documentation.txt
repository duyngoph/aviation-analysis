Potential Explorations for Analysis:
Seasonality Trends:

Examine ticket sales, prices, or passenger volume by quarter to understand seasonal patterns (e.g., increased travel in summer or holidays).
Year-over-Year Trends:

Compare quarterly data across years to identify growth, decline, or disruptions (e.g., COVID-19 impact in 2020â€“2021).
Airport-Specific Analysis:

Focus on major Californian airports like LAX, SFO, SAN, OAK, and SMF to analyze trends specific to these hubs.
Route Analysis:

Study popular routes originating in California and their quarterly trends in ticket pricing or volume.
Price Fluctuations:

Analyze how ticket prices vary across quarters and over the years to detect patterns or anomalies.
External Events Correlation:

Investigate how external events (e.g., economic downturns, fuel price changes, pandemic) affected air travel trends by quarter.
Methods to Maximize Insights Despite Limited Time Granularity:
Aggregate Data at the Quarter Level:

Sum, average, or calculate medians for metrics like ticket prices, sales, or passenger volumes for each quarter.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features such as:
Season indicator: Assign a season to each quarter (e.g., Q1 = Winter, Q2 = Spring).
Post-pandemic period: Flag quarters after the start of 2021 for post-pandemic recovery analysis.
Visualization:

Use Tableau or other tools to create visual representations such as:
Line charts for trends over time.
Heatmaps for quarterly data distribution across years.
Geographic maps to show trends specific to airports.
Comparative Analysis:

Analyze California vs. other states to highlight differences.
Compare major airports in California (e.g., LAX vs. SFO).
Quarterly Proxies for Events:

Use quarters as proxies for specific time frames (e.g., Q4 often reflects holiday travel).
